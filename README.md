# Selected projects

The following two projects are selected with equal weight. While neither aimed to solve any particular academic problem, they both served as a solution to inconveniences I faced. 

 1. **Howdy** was the first app I published. It used Bluetooth to communicate between devices. It was programmatically difficult for me when I attempted to create it in 2015.
 2. **GNNHS** is another app I published in more recent years. This app served as a challenge for me because there was no clear roadmap when I first started. My school did not have any publically available API's or datasets. Every call my app makes goes to a server I created which aggregates and serves data in a friendly format.
