*An iOS app for peer to peer texting when internet access is unavailable or restricted.*

Published in 2015, the app:

 - Broadcasts the device name
 - Displays a list of nearby users
 - Enables instant messaging between users

The app utilizes the MultipeerConnectivity framework and was made to circumvent internet restrictions while I was a middle school student.
